# Supabase Configuration
# Retrieve these from your Supabase Project Dashboard -> Settings -> API

# ==========================================
# Deployment Instructions (Production)
# ==========================================
# Since .env.local is not committed, you must manually set these keys in your CI/CD provider:
#
# 1. Vercel (Frontend & API):
#    Go to: Settings -> Environment Variables
#    Add: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY (and Service Role Key only if needed by API Routes)
#
# 2. GitHub Actions (Cron Jobs/Scripts):
#    Go to: Repo Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions
#    Add: SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY (as a Repository Secret)
#
# ==========================================

# The public URL of your Supabase project (Safe to expose to browser)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=

# The anonymous key (Safe to expose, limited by RLS policies)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

# The service role key (backend only, bypasses RLS - DO NOT SHARE OR COMMIT)
# Required for running scripts like 'seed.ts'
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
